# MaxQuantPrivate

This is a private fork of the https://github.com/LabKey/MaxQuant module. While the module itself
is open source, we've temporarily kept it private to protect the sample data files shared by Jake
Kennedy (jkennedy@fredhutch.org) from the Hutch. As soon as the paper that they're attached to has 
been published we should incorporate the changes here with the original LabKey MaxQuant module 
(via a pull request, most likely) and flip TeamCity and dev machines to point to it, and delete 
this repository.
